# Forecasting-Sales-using-Time-series-models
# Overview
This project implements Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal ARIMA models to forecast monthly champagne sales data. ARIMA models are a popular choice for time series forecasting, providing insights into future trends and patterns based on historical data.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Conducted data visualization, stationarity testing, and differencing to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Construction: Utilized ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA components to build forecasting models.
Prediction: Made accurate predictions of future champagne sales based on historical patterns.
Visualization: Visualized predicted sales trends for better understanding and decision-making.
# Usage
Requirements: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib).
Data Preparation: Load the monthly champagne sales data and preprocess it using visualization and stationarity testing.
Modeling: Implement ARIMA or Seasonal ARIMA models based on the characteristics of the data.
Prediction: Make predictions using the trained models and visualize the forecasted sales trends.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models based on accuracy metrics and visual inspection.
